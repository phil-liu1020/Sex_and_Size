# Sex_and_Size
This project contains all the codes needed for numerical simulaitons in the paper "Sex and size: a simple unified explanation for diversity and plasticity in parthenogen reproductive strategies".

Simulations for Figure 2 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_Many_Realisations with parameters as specified in the figure caption.

Simulations for Figure 3 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_EvolBranching with parameters as specified in the figure caption.

Simulations for Figure 4 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Gillespie_Many_Realisations with parameters as specified in the figure caption.

Simulations for Figure S2 and S3 are obtained using Invasion_Dynamics with parameters as specified in the figure caption. 

Simulations for Figure S4 are obtained using Invasion_Dynamics_Mass_FRTI_FixedSw with parameters as specified in the figure caption.

The data for Figures S5 to S8 as well as S13 and S14 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_EvolBranching, with parameters as described in the caption.

The data for Figures S9 to S12 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_Switching_Gillespie_Branching.
