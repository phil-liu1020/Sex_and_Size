# Sex_and_Size
This project contains all the codes needed for numerical simulaitons in the paper "Sex and size: a simple unified explanation for diversity and plasticity in parthenogen reproductive strategies".

Simulations for Figure 2 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_Many_Realisations with parameters as specified in the text.

Simulations for Figure 3 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Mass_Alpha_EvolBranching with parameters as specified in the text.

Simulations for Figure 4 are obtained using Evol_Dynamics_Gillespie_Many_Realisations with parameters as specified in the text.
