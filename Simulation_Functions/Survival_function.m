function f = Survival_function(mgenotypes,alphagenotypes,x,S,beta,C)

% Simulates the frequency after each successive generation.
% x is the output of the function "Fertilisation_Kinetics" which represents the number of cells of each type e.g. number of unfused cells of genotype 1, number of genotype 1 cells that have fused with genotype 3 etc.
% \beta is the resistance to survival and C is the fusion cost as defined in the text.
% mgenotypes and alphagenotypes are the mass and fusion rates of each genotype.

Mv=map_cell_types(S);  % writes the array Mv which is used to determine what each column of x (each ODE) represents. e.g. when S=2, x(4) represents F^{1}_{2} the number of genotype 1 cells that've fused with genotype 2 cells.
