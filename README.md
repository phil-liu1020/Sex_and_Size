Evolutionary_trajectories:
This is the function for simulating evolutionary trajectories for all case scenarios. It has the option to produce a single realisation or multiple independent realisations. 
              
              Evolutionary_trajectories_Many_realisations:
              This function produces multiple realisations of the evolutionary trajectory by calling the function "Evolutionary_trajectories_1realisation". This                       function is applicable for simulating evolutionary trajectories under scenarios with plasticity, bet-hedging, fixed environment and alphamax. This does not               produce data on individual traits within each realisation of the simulation (i.e. cannot be used to visualise branching).
              
              Evolutionary_trajectories_1realisation:
              This function produces one single realisation of the evolutionary trajectory. This function is applicable for simulating trajectories for scenarios with               plasticity, bet-hedging, fixed environment and alphamax. This can also output data on individual traits within each realisation of the simulation.
